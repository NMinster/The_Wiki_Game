The_Wiki_Game

This Python program implements a version of the Wikippedia Game aka a "wikirace". In a wikirace, the goal is to navigate from one Wikipedia page to another, exclusively using the links on each page. This script aims to find a path from a starting Wikipedia page to a target Wikipedia page. 

E.g. Start on the wiki page for Ford Motor Company, your goal is to reach Lady Gaga. Using only internal links a solution is the following, Ford Motor Company-> Ford Field -> Madonna -> Lady Gaga.

This is acomplished programatically by the following outline:

get_links(): This function sends a request to the Wikipedia API to get all the links on a given Wikipedia page. It then returns a list of titles of these linked pages. This function is decorated with lru_cache to avoid repeated network calls for the same page.

get_common_links(): This function uses OpenAI's ChatCompletion API to chat with GPT-3.5-turbo model. It feeds in a system and user message to the model, where the user message is asking about common connections between the start and target pages. The returned model-generated message content is searched for common links between the pages.

get_score(): This function returns the number of times topics appear in a given link.

wikirace(): This function implements the core logic of the wikirace. It starts with the start page and uses breadth-first search to traverse the pages linked from the current page. It prioritizes the links that have higher scores determined by get_score(), meaning those having more common links or topics with the target. The search stops when it reaches the target page.

Execution: The script calls wikirace() with 'Python (programming language)' and 'Elvis Presley' as example arguments and prints the path from the start page to the target page.


Overall_thoughts

This program will identify the optimal path between two pages. However the wikirace as a game depends on speed, similar to the micromouse game where small robotic mice compete to solve a 16Ã—16 maze.

This implementation takes a "flood fill" approach, similar to micromouse, where the mice will solve the maze by assigning values to each of the cells in a maze where these values represent the distance from any cell on a maze to the destination cell. i.e. the shortest path wins. 

The wiki pages can be thought of as a maze, some links lead to dead ends, but by assigning a value to these links we can follow the path of lease resistance. 


IMPROVEMENTS

Here is a great princton presentation trying to slove the Kevin Bacon problem using graph methods.

There are some interesting approaches listed there with the cavet that there is no graph avaliable unless we build one.
